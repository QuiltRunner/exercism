# Exercism Solutions

Welcome to my Exercism repository! This is where I sync all of my coding exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org). 

## About this Repo

This repository contains all of my solutions to the various programming language tracks on Exercism. Each exercise reflects the process of learning with the goal of creating clean, readable, efficient code. 

## Structure

This repo is organized by language. Each folder corresponds to a lanuage track, and each subfolder contains individual exercises. 

```
├── python/
│   ├── exercise-1/
│   ├── exercise-2/
│   └── ...
├── javascript/
│   ├── exercise-1/
│   └── ...
```

## Testing

Most Exercism exercises include automated tests. To run them:
- Python: ```pytest``` of the provided test runner.
- JavaScript: ```npm test```.

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills.
- Write clean and expressive code. 
- Revisit exercises to refine style and approach. 
- Track progress across languages. 

## Notes

If an exercise includes additonal commentary, insights, or alternative solutions, you'll find them inside that directory for that exercise. 

## Contributing

This repo is for personal progress, but feedback and suggestions are welcome. Open an issue or drop a PR if you see something fun to tweak.
